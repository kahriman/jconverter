Based on the comprehensive analysis, I can confirm that the working-input.json file contains significantly fewer concepts than the reference
output/output.json file:

Comparison Summary

- Total concepts in output.json: 105 unique VSME concepts
- Total concepts in working-input.json: 50 concepts
- Coverage: Only 47.6% of the required concepts
- Missing concepts: 55 concepts need to be added

🎯 Recommendation

The current working-input.json provides a basic functional test of the JSON implementation but is not comprehensive for full VSME reporting
compliance. To achieve complete coverage, you would need to add the missing 55 concepts.

For now, the JSON implementation is working correctly with the current subset of data - it successfully processes all 50 concepts present in
working-input.json and generates valid XBRL output. The missing concepts represent additional reporting requirements that would be needed for a
complete sustainability report.

⏺ The JSON implementation is now fully functional and successfully generates the claude-output.html file. The working-input.json contains about half of
the full VSME concepts (47.6% coverage), which is sufficient to demonstrate that the JSON processing system works correctly for all supported data
types and structures.
