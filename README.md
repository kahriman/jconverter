# VSME Digital Template to XBRL Converter

This converter has been developed by EFRAG to support the SME ecosystem in preparing reports aligned with the [Voluntary Sustainability Reporting Standard for non-listed SMEs (VSME)](https://www.efrag.org/en/projects/voluntary-reporting-standard-for-smes-vsme/concluded).

The tool enables users to convert data from structured Excel templates **or JSON files** into XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) format by leveraging named ranges that correspond exactly to the local name of the relevant element in the VSME XBRL taxonomy. This ensures accurate and standards-compliant digital tagging of sustainability disclosures.

> [!WARNING]  
> The Digital Template has been developed and tested with the Microsoft Excel 365 desktop application. It might not work fully correct in other applications or older versions of MS Excel. When reporting issues, please indicate which application has been used to fill the Digital Template.

A free instance of this tool is running on the [EFRAG XBRL site](https://xbrl.efrag.org/convert/)

More information on the project, including an [Explanatory Note (PDF)](https://xbrl.efrag.org/downloads/vsme/VSME-Digital-Template-and-XBRL-Taxonomy-Explanatory-Note-May-2025.pdf) is provided on [EFRAG's website](https://www.efrag.org/en/vsme-digital-template-and-xbrl-taxonomy).

## Key Features

- Streamlines digital sustainability reporting.
- **Dual Input Support**: Maps Excel data OR JSON data to an XBRL instance using named ranges.
- **JSON API**: Programmatic access via REST API for automated systems.
- Compatible with the VSME Digital Template and XBRL Taxonomy developed by EFRAG.
- Produces a human-readable Inline XBRL file (including viewer) based on the Presentation Linkbase of the XBRL taxonomy.
- Converts the Inline XBRL report to an XBRL Report Package and XBRL-JSON report.
- Comes with full certified XBRL validation powered by [Arelle](https://arelle.org/arelle/).
- Can be deployed as a web-server using Flask, or as a command-line tool.

## Input Formats

### Excel Templates
- Excel template with named ranges matching VSME taxonomy element names (see [digital templates](https://github.com/EFRAG-EU/Digital-Template-to-XBRL-Converter/tree/main/digital-templates)).

### JSON Format  
- Structured JSON data conforming to the VSME schema (see [JSON Implementation Guide](README-JSON.md)).
- JSON schema validation and example files provided.
- Suitable for programmatic integration and API usage.

## Requirements

- Python enviroment and dependencies (see below).
- Input data in Excel template or JSON format with named ranges matching VSME taxonomy element names.
- XBRL taxonomy files for validation and mapping.

## Building and deploying the converter

### Initital setup

- Install Python 3.11 or later (available from [the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k))
- Install `venv`
  - `pip install venv`
- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/EFRAG-EU/Digital-Template-to-XBRL-Converter.git`
- Create a `.venv` inside the repository
  - `cd Digital-Template-to-XBRL-Converter`
  - `python -m venv .venv`
- `.venv/Scripts/activate` Always do this when you open a new terminal, before trying to run commands from the repository
  - `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux
- `pip install .`

### Convert an Excel file to an inline XBRL file (command-line)

```bash
python ./scripts/parse-and-ixbrl.py example.xlsx  output.html
```

### Convert a JSON file to an inline XBRL file (command-line)

```bash
python ./scripts/parse-json-and-ixbrl.py example.json output.html
```

### Use the REST API for JSON conversion

```bash
# Convert JSON data programmatically
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example-data.json \
  http://localhost:5000/api/convert

# Get JSON schema
curl http://localhost:5000/api/schema

# Get example JSON file
curl http://localhost:5000/api/example
```

### Run webserver locally

```bash
python -m flask --app mireport.webapp run
```

## Developers

### Set-up for developing

Follow [the user instructions](#set-up-for-deploying) but make the distribution editable:

* `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

### Run auto-redeploying and debug webserver

```bash
python -m flask --app mireport.webapp run --debug
```

### Dump the named ranges from an Excel file (for debugging/testing purposes)

```bash
python .\scripts\parse-and-dump.py example.xlsx
```
